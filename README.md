<h1 align="center">volume_control_for_voicemeeter</h1>

A simple and tiny tray application that syncs the **in-Windows** volume of the `VoiceMeeter Input (VAIO)` audio output device to the volume of the first virtual input strip **in Voicemeeter** (which corresponds to that same device).

This allows the built-in Windows volume slider üéöÔ∏è, any mixer apps' (e.g. sndvol.exe, EarTrumpet, etc) sliders üéöÔ∏è as well as gestures and keyboard volume keys ‚å®Ô∏è to control the volume of Voicemeeter.

### Features

* Instead of constantly polling the volume slider for changes, this app uses the built-in Windows' `IAudioEndpointVolumeCallback` interface, thanks to which, the program is **completely idle** and not using **any** CPU resources when the volume isn't being changed.
* Tracks the volume changes of specifically the `VoiceMeeter Input` audio device instead of the typical approach of tracking whatever the default windows audio device is, meaning that **VoiceMeeter's input volume will be properly synced even when it *isn't* set as default** (useful when outputting audio from different applications to different devices)
* Tiny footprint (**0%** CPU, **0.5mb** RAM).
* The application properly unregisters with Voicemeeter's API when exiting, which prevents leaking resources and causing visual weirdness in the Voicemeeter's GUI.
* Tray icon visually consistant with that of Voicemeeter.
